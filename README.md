# 🚗 Car Rental System in C++

## 📌 Overview
This project is a simple console-based **Car Rental System** developed in **C++**, simulating the features of a real-life car rental service. The system allows users to:
- Sign up and log in
- View available cars and their features
- Book a car for a specified number of days
- Generate invoices
- Manage and add account balance
- View booking history
- Return rented cars

The system is implemented using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and makes use of basic file handling to store data persistently.

## 🎯 Features Implemented
- 🔐 User Authentication (Sign Up / Log In)
- 🚘 View car catalog with model, rent price, reviews
- 📅 Select rental days and book a car
- 🧾 Generate invoice/bill for the booking
- 💰 Balance management (add balance, deduct on booking)
- 🕓 View full booking history
- 🔁 Return a car and delete booking from history
- 🗃️ File handling using text files for data persistence

## 👨‍💻 Skills Applied
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Use of classes and objects, encapsulation
- **File Handling**: Use of `fstream` for reading/writing files
- **CLI Application Design**: Menu-driven interface
- **Logic Building**: Workflow simulation based on real car rental systems
- **Debugging and Problem Solving**: Identifying and resolving errors during development

## 📚 What I Learned
- Designing real-life systems using C++
- Structuring a project with multiple responsibilities using OOP
- Storing and retrieving data using file streams
- Building user workflows through logical flowcharts
- Planning and documenting software projects effectively

## 🛠️ How to Run the Program
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-rental-system-cpp.git
   ```
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (like g++):
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o car_rental
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./car_rental
   ```

## 🧱 Future Improvements
- Add GUI using libraries like Qt or SFML  
- Store data using SQLite or MySQL instead of text files  
- Secure login system with encrypted passwords  
- Admin panel to manage cars, users, and transactions  
- Better error handling and user feedback system
